# Unity-projects

They can only be opened by Unity, since I never really export them....
These projects are made when I read "Unity in Action", which provides
detailed instruction for these projects.

Also non-crucial folders are ignored because Unity can recompile them.
Such folders include Library, Temp, and Obj.
